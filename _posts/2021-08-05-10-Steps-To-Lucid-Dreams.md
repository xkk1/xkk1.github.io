# <span id="welcome">Welcome!</span>

![Welcom](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/4cacdc3fd9acd295e79f5e34b/images/c4d13c5b-48bc-4122-b526-cd089b8534c2.jpg)

Hey xkk  

Thanks for signing up to Ten Steps to Lucid Dreams!  

My name is Chris Hammond and I'm the Founder of World of Lucid Dreaming Academy.  

So my job here is basically to get you lucid.  

And rest assured, I won't give up.  

Until you either have your first lucid dream… or you tell me to go away ;-)  

(which hopefully won't happen!)  

**I've broken this e-course up into 10 daily lessons.**

Each day you get a fully structured lesson delivered to your inbox.  

I put a lot of time and effort into creating this course. I like to think it's more comprehensive than anything similar out there. To be honest, it actually trumps many of the 'paid' lucid dreaming courses that sell for hundreds of dollars, so we hope you enjoy it :-)  

The lessons are quite detailed. It would be best to read them when you have 10 minute's peace to quietly digest them - and appreciate the knowledge.  

Perhaps take ten minutes each evening, with a cup of chamomile tea. :-)  

The lessons have also been designed to be read and applied in order.  

If you accidentally miss a day, try and go back to catch up – you could be missing something important.  

## Your first lesson will arrive tomorrow.

Keep your eyes open for it – in case it gets lost in your junk mail folder. 

Add my email address to your Address Book right now, to make sure you get the ten lessons safely each day. :-) 

And most importantly – for the next ten days – you need to actually apply the lessons. 

**Each email contains specific instructions. Keep them up!** 

I'm all about achieving results. Stay with me during the next ten days and I promise I will teach you how to control your dreams. :-) 

In the meantime, here's 3 things you can do tonight.

- **Get a good night's sleep.** Sleep deprivation is not conducive to lucid dreaming.

- **As you get into bed look directly at your pillow and say out loud:** "I will remember my dreams tonight".

- **Passively observe the process of your mind and body falling asleep.** How does your body relax? How does your mind find peace? How does it feel to pay attention to these things?

This will help prime you for the incredible journey you're about to begin.... 

Best wishes,

# <span id="Day1">Day #1 – First Principle: Dream Recall</span>

![Day1](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/4cacdc3fd9acd295e79f5e34b/images/8ead8d17-cbf1-4cd8-bf84-060cfbb76870.jpg)

Hey xkk

As promised, here's step #1 of 10.

In the first three lessons, we're going to cover the 3 fundamental principles of lucid dreaming.

Pay close attention, as if you ever get lost in your lucid journey – you can return back to these principles to find your feet.

Later, we'll then move onto specific induction techniques that build upon this foundation.

## First Principal: Dream Recall



![write](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/4cacdc3fd9acd295e79f5e34b/images/fbc0acf2-6620-4866-b9a2-b7ffbccc1d86.jpg)

The art of lucid dreaming is built on the foundation of being able to *remember* your dreams! 

It's no good having an awesome dream - flying yourself through an erupting volcano and absorbing the energy of the lava - if you can't *remember* it! 

If someone screams in the forest and no one hears them, did they scream at all?

Right?  :-) 

But if you don't normally remember your dreams, that's OK. We'll teach you how to build up and improve your recall. 

**The most important thing you must do is keep a dream journal.** 

This simple practice helps you in several ways:

- It lays down a long term memory of your dreams as soon as you awaken.

- It encourages the mental habit to automatically remember your dreams.

- It highlights repeating themes - and dream signs that can trigger lucidity.

- It entrains the mindset that your dreams are important to you.

- It helps improve your self-awareness in future dreams.

All of these directly develop your ability to lucid dream. 

So, make it a habit to write down your dreams as soon as you wake up. Here's how: 

First, grab yourself a journal. 

This can be any old notebook you have hanging around. Or, if you really can't find anything, you can buy nice custom ones quite cheaply on Amazon. 

But you can achieve the same effect with a simple pen and paper (without denting your wallet). 

Don't worry if you couldn't find anything and had to order a pad in. Just grab a wad of paper from somewhere – to keep you going for the next few days. We need to get this program moving! ;-)

Remember – we're all about results guys. 

Grab your journal and write down these tips in your own words – in the front cover of your dream journal - right now! 


## Dream Recall Tips


Firstly, make a promise to give yourself 5-10 minutes *silent peace* each morning when you wake up – to focus your attention on your dreams. During this time you are barred from looking at your mobile phone! 

Your mind will do what you train it to do. If you always jump out of bed and straight onto Facebook, it's no wonder you don’t remember your dreams! 

**Waking is a special time of day!**

Give yourself a chance to slowly transition from the dream world to the waking world – and remember the dreams you have just experienced. 

Secondly, you must set *intent* each night. For the next ten days, every night before you goto bed, I want you to look at your pillow and say three times out loud: "I will remember my dreams". Say it with intent, like you mean it! 

Using this technique you are subconsciously programming yourself! It works, you'll see. 

Lastly, when writing in your dream journal, use these general practices:

- **Record** a title and date of your dream to help you identify it later. Write a capital "L" for lucid in a circle if you became lucid at any point.

- **Record** your most vivid dreams in as much detail as you can. Include emotions you felt. Once a dream is cemented in reality, you have a more permanent memory (like a real event).

- **Write** in the present tense (e.g., "I am flying high when the sky opens up and transports me to another dimension") as this will help put you back in the moment.

- **Underline** dream signs. These are any impossible details of the dream, which might have helped you become lucid (e.g., "I ran head first into oncoming traffic").

- **Sketch** the most important scene from your dream. You don't have to be an artist - these images just help underpin your visual recall.



## Summary


Today's lesson was pretty simple:

- Start writing down your dreams!

- Set intention before you go to bed ("I will remember my dreams")

- Give yourself 5 minutes peace to reflect when you first wake up, before using your phone.

Don't worry if you don't see results the very first day. Keep it up! 

*Persistence* is key while learning the ability to lucid dream. 

You'll gradually start to notice that you remember more and more detail as you keep going... The more you write down, the better you get! 

It's OK if you don’t remember your dreams every night. But after a while, you should start to get a few entries in your journal every week. 

If you *never* remember your dreams. Don't worry. We’ll cover more options in future lessons. 

But for now, start writing – beginning tonight! 

Best wishes,

Chris Hammond

# <span id="Day2">Day #2 – Second Principle: Waking Awareness</span>



![Day2](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/4cacdc3fd9acd295e79f5e34b/images/401d1040-9e97-4c85-8ea6-16158746eb8a.jpg)

xkk

One of the most wonderful things about lucid dreaming is that it will change your entire perspective on life!

That may sound like a grand claim – but it's absolutely true!

It's simply not possible to invoke *consciousness* during a dream without having a good, solid appreciation of it during your waking life. :-)

You see, lucid dreaming isn't just about having fun controlling your dreams - detonating nuclear bombs with a blink of your eyelid – or travelling backwards in time to visit the kings of ancient civilizations.

Sure you can do that...

But it's also about understanding the *power of your own mind* – and discovering a deeper appreciation of the nature of our conscious experiences.

So today we'll talk a little about mindfulness, or as some call it 'lucid waking'.

## Second Principal: Waking Awareness

![nature](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/4cacdc3fd9acd295e79f5e34b/images/d30485af-048e-4bc8-b5e7-99401c9f0323.jpg)

*Mindfulness* is a key lucid dreaming strategy.

This means being aware of your reality in your everyday waking life. Some experts call it 'lucid waking'.

Many people don't realize the impact that lucid waking has on their dream life... But they are overlooking one of the foundations of lucid dreaming.

**To start, let's take a quick test of your current lucid waking skills.**

Try hard to fully recall a time when you were surrounded by nature.

Do it *now* before reading on. I'll wait ;-)

OK. So maybe you thought for a moment and drew a quick memory of a time you went hiking, or for a stroll in the park. Perhaps a camping trip or holiday.

But then you stopped engaging in that memory... and rushed back to the task at hand - reading this email!

This is the mindset we tend to have when we rush about our busy lives. It's difficult to stop and smell the roses. There are so many distractions vying for our attention.

**Like regular dreams, our awareness of detail is fuzzy. We're not fully lucid.**

If you engaged in lucid waking, you would take at least a minute to visualize or recall the memory in maximum detail.

Perhaps you closed your eyes and took some deep breaths. Imagined yourself right there in the scene: saw the stillness of the water, looked into the deep blue sky, smelled the air, felt the warmth of the sun bearing down on your face. And so on.

The image above represents the two different kinds of perception at play.

So, where are you on the spectrum? Is there room for improvement?

There are some very simple – but powerful - practices you can use to enhance your lucid waking. Or in other words: improve your mindfulness of waking consciousness.

**So here's what I want you to do today.**

(and every day for the next 10 days, whilst you're doing this course)

It's enjoyable - and it only takes a few minutes!

Do this whilst you’re walking along the street:

Slowly close your eyes for a moment and inhale deeply. *Slow* down your every movement and thought. There is no rush.

Concentrate on the feeling of the breath getting sucked down your throat. Examine every inch of the air. Appreciate how it feels coursing over the surface of your air passage and into your lungs. Note to yourself how every single breath is *unique* and *different*.

Don't think about anything else. Do this for about 1-2 minutes.

It's hard - you'll be tempted to rush!

You'll probably be surprised at how hard it is as a beginner to hold your attention for even two minutes on just one thing.

**If you find thoughts creeping in, don't get frustrated – just let the thoughts drift away, like clouds – and return to your breath.**

Now we're going to look at each sense in turn.

As you are walking, focus your attention purely on your feet. Feel the soles of your feet impacting with the pavement, or the grass. Feel each and every indentation of the ground and how the energy of each one subtly reverberates up through your feet and transfers into your body. Feel your legs and how the individual muscles work as they move. Focus on these things and do not let your train of thought take you away on a tangent.

This is walking meditation!

Now sound. Focus your attention purely on your ears and the waves of sound going into them. You may close your eyes (but don't walk into anything!!) to assist. Appreciate every subtle sound around you. Most of the time we are lost in our own thoughts. But what about the small sounds of birds chirping, or traffic passing? Gently listen to the people talking in the background. The bark of dog. This is reality!

Finally, we will focus on our sight. Look. Truly look, for the first time. As if you are born anew. Look at the trees as you pass. Or the buildings. See them as if for the first time. Examine every minute detail. The patterns and fractals on every leaf. The tiny individual surfaces of every pebble or grain of gravel in every paving stone.

**This is consensus reality! Based on your brain processing your senses.**

You may feel as if you have truly walked for the first time in your life!

## Summary


When you become more mindful - even just for a few minutes every day – you think more lucidly in the moment.

The more you practice it during the day time, the more automatic it becomes at *night*, too.

Over time this awareness will assist your mind to recognise when you are dreaming and therefore become conscious inside that dream.

Have a think about that guys – and stay tuned.

Because tomorrow we delve into awareness during sleep.

Yours,

Chris Hammond

xkk

Hope you're enjoying these emails!

By now you've probably figured out that lucid dreaming is just like any other skill.

**That is, it takes time and effort to learn. :-)**

I like to think of it a bit like learning a new language or playing an instrument. You'll start off pretty shaky, but as you keep up practice you'll find yourself starting to see real results!

So, don't give up on me – keep up your lessons and make a point of doing everything I tell you to do. By the end of this course, you’ll have an infinitely deeper understanding of the dream world and how you can become conscious there.

On average, most beginners start to see results within the first 2 weeks of practice.

**So keep at it!**

Once you get your first taste of real lucidity, you'll realise its power. :-)

Lucid dreaming is an amazing skill that I built into my life – alongside martial arts, yoga and meditation.

So, whether you want to:

- Inspect your own insecurities, neurosis and psychological makeup in the comfort of your own mind.

- Practice skills in your dreams that transfer to improved ability in real-life.

- Have some fun: like controlling lightning bolts with your hands, walking into a raging fire and absorbing its energy, or simply becoming a tree and losing touch with human consciousness and ego.

- Or simply have your wicked way with Kylie Minogue or Brad Pitt – it's all good to me.

Then you're in the right place.

Stick to my guidance and I will get you there. Promise!

Today's lesson builds on yesterday's.

We are going to look at awareness whilst *sleeping* – or, specifically, whilst *falling* asleep.

With a simple exercise to practice at bed time.

## Third Principal: Sleeping Awareness

![eye](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/4cacdc3fd9acd295e79f5e34b/images/18d51046-21e0-4be0-8cdd-f85971bb65e9.jpg)

Forget sensory deprivation tanks.

Today we'll learn how to shut off all physical sensory input and "fall asleep consciously".

**Don't worry, it's completely safe!**

And it can even be even quite easy once you get the knack for it.

You'll start to become aware for the first time of the *process* of falling asleep and how it feels through each stage!

And this can lead directly to lucid dreams.

The beauty of this technique is you can practice it any time or day or night. 

However it's most effective in the *early hours of the morning*, after you've had five or so hours of sleep. It doesn't take any energy. It relieves stress. And it feels really good...

## How Do You Relax?

Some people think relaxation involves a glass of wine. Maybe a take out dinner. Possibly slouching on the couch watching an evening of TV?

If you're lucky - an amazing back massage from your partner :-)

This kind of relaxation goes *way* deeper than any of that.

In a more profound kind of way.

**I'm talking about complete physical and mental detachment from the real world.**

This state of relaxation is a springboard to achieving deeper states of meditation and – ultimately - conscious *entry into the lucid dream world*.

When you feel like relaxing, lie down on your back in a dark, quiet room.

Take some deep breaths in and out... and start to feel the tension drain away from your muscles.

## Begin with Physical Relaxation

Begin by systematically visualizing each muscle group - and letting it relax into the bed, or go invisible, or float away. Whichever metaphor works for you.

Start with your toes: let them drop out of reality. Then your feet. Then your ankles. Focus your full attention on each body part and let it go before moving up... all the way to the top of your head. Remember to fully relax your face and jaw.

As you do this, sigh away the tension and allow your breathing to become gentle and rhythmic.

Once a body part has "left reality" *don't move it* - it's gone.

(If you must move to cough or scratch an itch, start over until you feel you're back to where you were before.)

This should take about 10 minutes, by which point you'll be feeling pretty relaxed. But this is only the beginning.

## Advance with Mental Relaxation

Start with observing your *hypnagogic imagery* - those floating or swirling patterns which form against your closed eyelids when you're tired.

Let it take your focus away from your physical body... into a primitive yet hypnotic dream world.

**If your body is relaxed but you don't see any emerging hypnagogia, do some sensory visualization instead:**

Imagine your arms or legs have completely disappeared. What does that feel like?

Imagine you're floating a few feet above your body, or are trying to sway your awareness out of it. Like you're on a swing at the park. Feel the sensation, *just as if it were real.*

After another 10 minutes, you should be deep in a state of total relaxation.

Your body is now so relaxed it sends few (if any) real sensory signals to your brain.

This makes it easy for you to create false signals with your mind. Any physical sensation you imagine now can feel very real - and can even tip you into the lucid dream world!

Your mind is focused *inwards*, far away from the trivial stresses of waking life.

You may keep your mind clear and open to spontaneous insights - or visualize a simulated inner-world, which again can lead you into a lucid dream in a matter of seconds.

## What If You Can't Relax?

The most common hurdle beginners face with this technique is silencing their *inner monologue*.

**Most people just don't know how to switch off their overactive brains.**

There are lots of ways to distract yourself from your inner voice - and eventually it will go quiet on its own. Just as you fall asleep without it every night.

One simple trick is to count slowly backwards in your mind in *threes*, starting from one hundred.

Another tactic is to focus on *slow breathing.*

And every time your inner voice chimes in with a distracting thought, allow it to wash quickly away.

**Crucially, your aim is to fall asleep physically but remain awake mentally.**

If that sounds alien at this stage, you're not alone!

Falling asleep consciously usually takes practice and determination - but you will come to master this as a lucid dreamer.

For the next few nights, go to bed a little earlier than usual and give yourself time to perform this technique as practice.

And try it again any time you *wake up* in the night.

(it's easier to induce a lucid dream then too).

You'll open yourself up to a blissful meditation experience. And maybe even some surprising dream-time phenomena…

Best wishes,

Chris Hammond

# <span id="Day4">Day #4 – Reality Checks</span>



![Day4](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/4cacdc3fd9acd295e79f5e34b/images/cc8f3443-90bf-43d2-982a-bbaea2ec56b8.jpg)

Hey xkk

Chris here again!

Hopefully by now you've managed to grab some paper and have been jotting down your dreams for the last few nights!

You've been practicing your self-awareness during the days by appreciating your senses in the moment.

And you've been starting to cultivate awareness at bed time with yesterday's relaxation exercise.

And don't forget: you’ve got my personal guarantee… I’ll get you lucid! Somehow! No matter what. Somehow I'll do it – and I won't give up. So long as you're with me.

**So let's do this!**

We'll get to work on a new techniques in the next few minutes.

You can practice it any time of day. And it only takes 30 seconds.

## Reality Checks

![hand](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/4cacdc3fd9acd295e79f5e34b/images/d587c74a-2d51-4b6b-ac40-7f15bf91e117.jpg)

Today's lesson is slightly meatier.

We're covering one of the highest-rated techniques among beginners. Quite simply because it's easy to perform and is highly effective at producing spontaneous lucid dreams.

What's the simplest way for a beginner to become lucid in their dreams?

**It's to spontaneously realize that you're dreaming!**

Let's say you’re having high tea with Arnold Schwarzenegger, when a herd of flying pigs begin to circle overhead. 

The sky turns pink and cracks in two, as Arnie begins to shuffle menacingly towards you.

You realize: "Oh my God. This isn't real! I'm DREAMING!"

With this mind-bending *realization*, all the elements of the dream snap into focus!

It becomes as vivid and real as the reality you perceive right now.

With the *realization* that you are dreaming, comes consciousness. And this presence of mind allows you to take control of the dream.

**Will you:**

- Run at extreme speeds and explore the dreamscape just beyond the horizon?

- Engage Arnie in hand-to-hand combat, or a game of high-stakes mah-jong?

- Conjure up an almighty banquet and feast on exotic and extravagant foods?

- Or shout out to the dream: "Show me my life in 20 years!"

So, now you're lucid in the dream! Or in other words, lucid dreaming.

## How to Trigger This Realization


So far in your life, you've already had thousands of dreams - which you just *accepted* as reality.

It wasn't until you woke up that you realized you were dreaming all along!

So how can you create an in-dream trigger, to spark the realization you are dreaming?

**With a simple brain hack known as a "reality check".**

A reality check is an attempt to perform an impossible action.

For example, trying to push your hand through a desk. 

If you do this in reality, it proves you are awake. No surprise there.

However, in dreams, the impossible happens! So when you try to push your hand through the desk, it can slide right though. It offers *proof* that you are dreaming.

Try to do it right now (seriously).

As you do this, ask yourself: "Am I dreaming?"

**Ok great. You've just done your first reality check.**

And it took all of 10 seconds. :-)

From now on, I want you to perform 10-20 reality checks spread out through every day.

Literally try to push your fingers through the desk, wall, or the palm of your hand - *imagining* how it would look and feel if you actually managed to do it.

All the while, ask yourself: "Is this a dream?"

But you have to ask the question with *complete seriousness*.

It's no good just “going through the motions”. You have to pay 100% attention and focus on what you are doing.

When pushing into your hand, examine the feeling in detail.

Take note of how it feels physically and mentally. Don't stop until you have satisfied yourself 100% that you are awake – and *why* you believe that is the case (are you sure you're not dreaming right now?).



## Summary


"What is real? If real is what you can feel, smell, taste and see, then 'real' is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain."

**- Morpheus, ** ***The Matrix***

When you dream, your brain simulates electrical impulses that give you a sense of an artificial reality. An inner world which only you can perceive.

You may be walking barefoot through a park, listening to birdsong, feeling the sun on your skin. Out of context, it is hard to tell whether you're awake or dreaming - because both dreams and reality deliver the same type of experience to your brain.

Reality checks help us to "realize" that we are dreaming.

**In doing so the conscious brain takes over and we become lucid.**

Your daily reality checks are going to feed into your dreams very soon now.

You'll be having a dream about something very improbable... then *by habit,* you'll do a reality check in the dream.

It will provide absolute confirmation that you are dreaming.

And you will become instantly lucid!

Start right now – reality check. Do one again in another hour or so. Don't let up!

I'll be in touch soon with your next lesson tomorrow.

xkk

OK, things are about to start getting intense! 

We've laid the ground work for you over the past 4 days covering the foundational principals of lucid dreaming (dream recall and awareness). 

Yesterday we started doing daily reality checks. 

Now we're going to start looking at *hypnagogia* and cover our first actual lucid dream induction technique. 

Crazy!

## Exploring Your Hypnagogia

![hypnagogia](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/4cacdc3fd9acd295e79f5e34b/images/25a04acf-e9ec-4c0e-b5c9-ff0b34593053.jpg)

Hypnagogia is the natural visual state that appears around the onset of sleep and dreams. 

It's characterized by fluorescent visuals behind your closed eyelids - starting with slowly swirling lights and geometric patterns, advancing to familiar faces and entire landscapes. 

If you've ever stayed awake that far into your hypnagogia, you'll have an idea of how complex and impressive these visuals can become. 

You may remember doing this as a child. I know I did!

And if you remain conscious long enough (fully relaxing your body into sleep), you'll find that hypnagogic visions can take you all the way into the lucid dream world. 

**It's easiest to observe your hypnagogia when you're tired.** 

Lie down in a dark room and calm yourself.

Perform the relaxation technique we covered in Day #3 - and the fluorescent hypnagogia will start to emerge from the darkness. 

When the hypnagogic imagery appears, gently follow it for a minute and then try to *mentally will it* into different shapes. 

In your mind, tell the shapes to become horizontal lines, circles, squares, hexagons or grids. It really does bend to your will!

Now try for something more complex.

Summon the face of a loved one, or an animal. As you focus on these drifting visuals, you will begin to hypnotize yourself into a deeper meditative state. 

Bizarrely, the hypnagogic state can also include physical sensations (like floating), sounds (people calling your name), and even fleeting imaginary sensations of taste, smell and heat. 

**Be prepared to encounter these sensations with more intensity as your body falls asleep.** 

When you feel your awareness is fully detached from the real world, go for the big one: shape your hypnagogia into an entire landscape! 

Start with the horizon, then add in other elements as layers - like a painting you can touch. This demands *visualization*.

## How to Visualize Your Lucid Dream

My favorite dream scenes to visualize are big sweeping landscapes. 

Imagine you're standing on a beach, for instance, and visualize looking out across the sand. Now will your hypnagogia to shape itself to this image. 

Then *intensify* each aspect of your visualization - in stages. 

Scan the horizon. Pick out vivid shapes, colors and textures. 

Put yourself in the moment and relish the intensity of the imagined scene. 

When you hit the sweet spot - in which your visualization becomes more convincing than your waking reality - you will fully "pop" into the landscape. 

It becomes a fully immersive dream environment. 

To an outsider you are officially asleep. But in your mind, you are wide awake... and dreaming.

## How to Make Your Practice More Effective

Some people need a little help inducing this "mind awake / body asleep" state from which the dream imagery develops. 

**I recommend a couple of lucidity aids:** 

**Brainwave Entrainment:** I'm a big fan of these beautiful audio tracks. There's a lot of scientific reseach on the subject too. Just try listening to some gentle *binaural beats* as you carry out the exercise in today's lesson. 

(you can grab some on YouTube for free - just search 'binaural beats')

**Lucid Dreaming Supplements:** There are natural herbs available that have significant effects on memory and dream recall. Galantamine or Huperzine-A taken around 4am is guaranteed to significantly intensify your hypnagogia. 

Don’t worry - if you're interested, we'll cover this option in more detail tomorrow.

## Summary

As you continue to explore the borderland sleep states, assume the mindset of an intrepid explorer of the inner realm (an *oneironaut* is the official name!) 

Meditation can open up some strange new pathways - so be prepared for some new experiences. 

Remain fearless... and keep probing!

Yours

# <span id="Day6">Day #6 – Lucid Dreaming Supplements</span>

![Day6](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/4cacdc3fd9acd295e79f5e34b/images/bcf8407b-664f-4c58-af28-425519dcf49b.jpg)

Hey xkk

The problem I get with most people is that they've become highly wary and desensitized to 'supplements' because of the body building industry. 

Most therefore assume that dreaming supplements are 'bunk', a 'gimmick' or simply 'won't work'. 

**I know this - because I thought the same thing too!** 

Until I started experimenting with them. 

In fact, lucid dreaming supplements are a *completely* different ball game. 

The official name is 'oneirogen'. Which means a substance that creates a *dream-like state of consciousness*. 

Others like to call them 'dream herbs'. 

**Exciting isn't it :-)** 

Any complete course on lucid dreaming has to cover supplements – and so today we'll take a short history lesson and cover some of the options of you have. 

To be clear, you don't have to take supplement to learn the art of lucid dreaming. Some people consider lucid dreaming a spiritual quest and prefer to do it entirely of their own volition. 

But - for those more intrepid dream explorers - supplements can simultaneously give you the *most intense and vivid dreamstates* of all – and provide that first taste of true lucidity, that will inspire you to continue your practice. 

## Lucid Dreaming Supplements

![img](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/4cacdc3fd9acd295e79f5e34b/images/a80580d4-f249-4b75-9bd9-d5896efba52f.jpg)

So this has been going on for a long time! 

Dream herbs are nothing new and many have been in use for thousands of years. 

For example, the Xhosa of South Eastern Africa have dreaming deeply embedded in their culture. They believe when their relatives die, they travel to the spirit realm. From where they communicate ancestral wisdom to us - via dreams. 

The Xhosa routinely consume a dream herb brew made from the roots of a plant called Silene Capensis. 

This is taken as part of a ritual initiation ceremony (during which they rub a slaughtered cow with the mixture and drink it mixed with blood – had to add that!) and is said to produce long and prophetic dreams. 

I'll assume, since their entire culture is based around this dream herb, that it works. :-) 

Similarly, Calea Zacatechichi was taken by Mexican shamans and has a like effect. 

The list of oneirogens goes on. Popular herbs include blue lotus, entada reidii and mugwort. 

The main problem with these more exotic herbs, is that they tend to be relatively subtle in their effects. This is compounded by the difficulty of finding a fresh and high quality source. The dried plant material you can order online tends to vary in strength – and in honesty, it's touch or go whether you'll notice anything at all.

## Lucid Dreaming Supplements: Pros vs Cons

There are some compelling reasons to try supplements:

**Pros:**

In my experience they breathe color into my dream life on a whole new level. They can produce the longest, most vivid and intense dreams of all - that feel more significant or profound than regular dreams.

Even if you've never had a lucid dream before, ramping up the intensity can help you better understand the awesome power of your dreaming mind. It can give you the push you need to commit to lucid dreaming.

Promoting self awareness in your dreams gives you more chances to become lucid.

**Cons:**

Lucid dream pills shouldn't provide the foundation of your training. They are a "treat". A once-in-a-while boost to your dream life. You should not come to rely on them to have lucid dreams.

As with any supplement, you should always consult your doctor prior to using. In some cases there can be side effects, contraindications and allergic or negative reactions.

## Picking Your Supplement

Most dream herbs work by elevating levels of certain memory related neurotransmitters in the brain. 

When it comes to picking what actually works, there are two main contenders to choose from: galantamine or huperzine-A. 

Both have herbal origins: galantamine being extracted from the Red Spider Lily and Huperzine-A from Chinese Club Moss. 

And both are backed by a wealth of scientific studies proving their safety and efficiency. In fact, both can be used to treat the symptoms of Alzheimer’s Disease - a memory related disorder.

But buckle your seatbelts! Using a strong supplement like this is an intense experience and will throw you directly into the deep end of the lucid dreaming universe! Treat these compounds with the respect they deserve and you will be rewarded. 

**Here are a few examples of the types of dream scenes you can expect:**

- Feeling the structure of a huge submarine flex and resonate under the pressure of water.

- Existing as a tree. Experiencing its collective living energy and letting go of human ego.

- Watching rows of nuclear missiles erupt in blazes of blue energy – and stopping them with a wave of the hand.

Just don’t forget – use dreaming supplements as a *tool* – in conjunction with the techniques I've taught you.

## What do we recommend?

As it happens, we have our own lucid dreaming supplement :-)

We crowd funded this back in 2017, when we raised over $25,861 from 335 members of our lucid dreaming community.

The idea was to create a product that was completely transparent.

It's since gone on to be a huge success, selling thousands of bottles and receiving 169 customer reviews - which you can check out [here](https://world-of-lucid-dreaming.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=4cacdc3fd9acd295e79f5e34b&id=dc1cf3ed34&e=c182e3a066).

# <span id="Day7">Day #7 – WBTB Technique</span>

![Day7](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/4cacdc3fd9acd295e79f5e34b/images/b8be67a2-d13f-45ac-8a7e-a8e8cc32b364.jpg)

xkk

In our last lesson we looked at dream supplements. Now here's a really easy lucid dreaming technique to try in combination with them.

It's called the Wake-Back-to-Bed Technique (WBTB).

This can work from day one, which is why so many beginners love it.

## WBTB Technique

![WBTB_img](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/4cacdc3fd9acd295e79f5e34b/images/0d63b303-9a83-4716-a469-156f118029c9.jpg)

You can perform WBTB every morning, or just on weekends to fit your work schedule:

- Go to bed as normal and sleep for around six hours (set your alarm clock to wake you up)

- Get out of bed and become fully alert. Write in your dream journal, read a good book about lucid dreaming - or otherwise occupy your mind with something dream-related.

- After 25 minutes, go back to bed and relax. Take your lucid dreaming supplement now, if you have one. Perform the full relaxation technique, and visualize your desired lucid dreamscape in detail.

That's it!

The Wake-Back-to-Bed technique will significantly increase your chances of having lucid dreams during your remaining sleep cycles.

And best of all... you can sleep in as long as you like. :-)

## So How Does WBTB Work?


This technique manipulates your sleep cycles around a crucial time of increased REM sleep. This is when your most vivid dreams occur.

Your premature awakening tricks the body into thinking it will be REM-deprived. How sneaky of you... When given the chance to return to sleep, your brain will dive straight into long periods of REM sleep, lapping up the "bonus" REM time essential to healthy brain function.

It really helps to spend the awake-time thinking and reading about lucid dreaming. This conscious focus can carry on into the dream world - a reminder that you're dreaming.

## The Hidden Bonus of WBTB


What's more, when practiced over time, you'll teach your brain to release its "wake up" hormones after six hours of sleep.

So even on the days you don't practice WBTB, your conscious mind will start to rouse when you are still enjoying blissful REM sleep.

This creates even more opportunities for lucid dreams...

Best wishes

# <span id="Day8">Day #8 – How to Stop a Lucid Dream Collapsing</span>

![Day8](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/4cacdc3fd9acd295e79f5e34b/images/91311bcd-e4f3-47c8-b194-66a959ff05f8.jpg)

xkk

I'll tell you what's going to happen.

I'm going to predict the future in fact…

You're shortly going to have your first lucid dream (if you haven't already) and it's going to be absolutely incredible!

You'll be breathing so fast and your heart will be *jumping* out of your chest - in awe that you're actually conscious inside a dream.

You'll be in shock saying "OH MY GOD, I'M ACTUALLY INSIDE A DREAM!!!"

And then it will all collapse after less than a minute :-)

But don't worry. An important part of the art of lucid dreaming is learning how to stop dream collapse and extend the duration of your lucid dreams.

Today's lesson covers just that.

## How to stop a lucid dream collapsing

![img](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/4cacdc3fd9acd295e79f5e34b/images/c8f92672-fcbb-42b5-a345-06c22de35ca3.jpg)

My first taste of lucidity was the same: an incredible experience - that collapsed after about 30 seconds. I woke up stunned... elated... and kicking myself I didn't make it last longer:

*"I'm standing in an empty white room, completely bare like a new house. The lack of detail makes me wonder... What is this place? Suddenly I realize, this is a dream!

The room surges into focus. I become fully conscious of my body and my surroundings. I do my reality check and feel my fingers push right through the palm of my hand.

I am so excited, I run out the door looking for someone to tell. I find a woman who I don't recognize and shout in her face. "I'M DREAMING! I'M DREAMING!"

I'm so excited, I accidentally wake myself up."*

I made the rookie mistake of getting excited and running around in the virtual dreamscape, telling a complete stranger that I was lucid dreaming.

**I got completely caught up in the emotion and squandered the opportunity!**

This is very common in beginners. But luckily there are some simple methods that will help you to:

- Keep your cool and stay grounded in the dream (no waking up)

- Heighten your lucidity (for the most intense lucid dreams)

- Gain full dream control (so you can do whatever you want)

**So here's exactly what to do when you next realize you're dreaming:**

- **Stay calm.** Don't run around telling everyone you're dreaming. Get a grip on what's happening and calmly observe your environment for a few moments.

- **Rub your hands together.** The movement stimulates the conscious brain and keeps you focused on your dream body.

- **Look at your hands.** Focus on your hands close-up and notice the finer details which aren't normally present in a dream. This produces greater self-awareness.

- **Do a reality check.** Push your hand into a solid object and expect it to go through, while asking "Am I dreaming?" This cements your awareness in the dream.

- **Demand "Clarity now!"** Tell your dream you want more clarity and your dreaming self will respond instantly by creating a more vivid environment.

These stabilization tips work best for me personally.

There are others which may work even better for you - like spinning around or falling backwards.

Experiment, explorer!

Best wishes

# <span id="Day9">Day #9 – Controlling Lucid Dreams</span>

![Day9](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/4cacdc3fd9acd295e79f5e34b/images/485e2119-a7e6-4f16-b175-256809b60723.jpg)

Hey xkk

Chris here as always.

Hope you're having as much fun as I am :-)

Today I'm going to give you some super specific tips on the most fun and liberating aspect of lucid dreaming: actually controlling your dreams.

Whether you want to fly to the moon, teleport to a fantasy world full of dragons and hobbits, summon your favourite movie star, or simply fly over the ocean like a bird – you'll need *control* to make this happen.

Remember, not every lucid dream you have will involve full control. Sometimes, you'll be aware you are dreaming – but will be merely a passive *observer* of the action. Like a movie.

**This is OK! Enjoy these incredible dreams too.**

Today we will learn how to take control of the dream environment and increase your chances of making the dream world take shape as you desire.

## Controlling Lucid Dreams

![img](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/4cacdc3fd9acd295e79f5e34b/images/6b970fe2-d64f-49d7-8af6-0ca32f493e8b.jpg)

Here's a classic example of a question from a newbie lucid dreamer:

*"I was lucid and I knew I was dreaming. But when I tried to fly, I couldn't lift off the ground, not even by a few inches. My dream refused to respond no matter how much I wanted it. Why couldn't I fly when I really wanted to?" - Amanda, UK*

If you've ever had a similar experience, you'll know how frustrating it is to be fully lucid, yet unable to control your dream.

What is going wrong here?

Well, it almost always boils down to one of two factors:

## Lack of Lucidity

Lucidity - or *consciousness* - can be a slippery devil. If for one moment you forget that you're dreaming, your ability to control the dream is diminished.

That's why it's so important to perform steps like dream stabilization

(which we covered in our last lesson).

**Indeed, sometimes you become so preoccupied by distractions in your amazing dream world that you can forget you are dreaming altogether.**

Sounds crazy? It's really not.

The sleeping brain presents an entirely separate state of consciousness.

There are different rules at play. Memory, language, cognition and self-awareness all function differently. So it's not hard to *forget* you're dreaming if you don't remind yourself regularly.

As a direct result, you can accidentally pass control of the dream back to your unconscious dreaming self! This is the part of you that produces all your normal dreams (and continues to co-create the experience even when you're fully lucid).

In Amanda's dream, her lucidity was weak and her unconscious mind had other intentions for her dream. Flying was not on the agenda.

Unfortunately, when you're stuck in this semi-lucid limbo, the unconscious mind tends to win over.

You must maintain *awareness* in lucid dreaming...

Which is a mindset you can entrain every day while awake.

## The Expectation Principle

Your underlying mindset defines the way you actively control your dreams.

If Amanda was fully lucid, then the problem was she didn't truly *expect* to be able to fly.

She had no confidence. In the back of her mind, her learned experience of gravity in real life blocked her ability to fly in her lucid dream.

**All she had to do was genuinely expect herself to lift off the ground!**

Note: expecting is different from wanting. It's like the difference between hoping you'll get a pay rise and knowing you're getting a pay rise. Confidence in a particular outcome means there is no doubt in your mind. And that makes *dream control* possible.

It also helps to voice your desires out loud. "I'm taking off into the air now."

Once you perform an impossible reality check in a lucid dream, it is much easier to expect other impossibilities too - like breathing underwater, teleporting across vast distances, and running through walls.

You can have a lot of fun finding out what's possible :-)

**Here are some other ways you could control your dreams using The Expectation Principle:**

- Change the scenery from a desert to a tropical rainforest - by turning away and expecting it to look like your desired location when you turn back.

- Travel through time 65 million years by stepping into a time machine and expecting to greet friendly dinosaurs when you emerge.

- Summon dream figures or personal heroes by saying to the dream "I'm going to meet Lara Croft around the corner" and truly expect to see her when you look.

- Find any dream object by reaching into your pocket and expecting to find it, or drawing a crude picture of it with your finger in the air and expecting it to come to life.

This is a powerful lesson in dream control.

Use it next time you're lucid - and you'll find these techniques really do work!

Yours

# <span id="Day10">Day #10 – Converting Sleep Paralysis</span>

![img](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/4cacdc3fd9acd295e79f5e34b/images/9c4270b7-36be-4bfb-837b-14c1a5295d08.jpg)

xkk

Last lesson today!

But it's an important one.

Today I'm going to tell you about the extraordinary state of *sleep paralysis*.

Because invariably – in your lucid dreaming journey – you will encounter this state. And you should be overjoyed when you do! Because it means an intense lucid dream and potentially an out-of-body experience is just around the corner.

So let's learn how to master it.

## Converting Sleep Paralysis to a Lucid Dream

![img](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/4cacdc3fd9acd295e79f5e34b/images/f836f7c2-4cb1-4eff-8233-4a80b264b02b.png)

Sleep paralysis is the very real feeling that you can't move your body when you wake from sleep.

If that sounds scary, let me reassure you that you this state - scientifically known as REM Atonia - already happens to you every single night!

**It's just that usually, you sleep right through it.**

The main purpose of REM Atonia is to stop you from acting out your dreams. And that's just as relevant when practicing lucid dreaming - else you might get out of bed and start making love to the wall!

When you start exploring with advanced lucid dreaming techniques and supplements, you can become aware of REM Atonia as it starts to kick in!

So if you do become aware of this, then you need to know how to respond – which is *really easy*.

**It's important to remember that sleep paralysis is a very good thing!**

It's direct proof that you are consciously aware whilst your body is asleep – a golden opportunity that you can convert directly into a lucid dream.

## Here's what to do if you feel sleep paralysis:

The first thing you will feel is a slight sense of panic ("I can't move!!!").

Don't fight this. *Relax* into it.

Remember to yourself: "this is sleep paralysis. Chris told me exactly how to handle this".

Remind yourself: this is a natural sensation. It can't hurt me. I am going to relax into it and make the most of the opportunity.

**Don't try to move your limbs – as this will feel frustrating.**

Instead, move your awareness away from your limbs and up to your *mind*.

Keep cool. Smile to yourself inwardly. Grin that you are about to experience an incredible lucid dream.

Keep repeating to yourself "I am dreaming".

Start to imagine yourself floating, whilst you relax.

Close your eyes and visualize a distant dream scene, like a snow-capped mountain.

**At the same time start to imagine you are on a swing. Feel the momentum in your body as you awing in arcs – back and forward.**

Keep concentrating on the *momentum* and the dream scene you want to swing towards. As you become totally immersed in these sensations, you will forget about your physical body and pop straight into a lucid dream!

Don't forget to stabilise by looking at your hands, performing a reality check and demanding clarity!

And if you really want to try something advanced...

Instead of swinging out into a dream, imagine your body *sitting up.* 

If you get it right, you will leave your body and float into your bedroom!

## Summary


One of the most confusing things about sleep paralysis - beyond that startling, set-in-stone sensation - is that it's hard to tell whether you are fully awake or dreaming in the darkness of your bedroom.

It can be a little scary the first few times, but that's only because it's weird and unknown :-)

Your positive mental attitude will overcome this. Forewarned is forearmed!

And most of all - even though it means probing uncharted territory...

Sleep paralysis is 100% *controllable*.

Sincerely

Chris Hammond

# <span id="firstdream">**xkk, did you have your first lucid dream yet?**</span>

xkk

It's been a few days since you completed 10 Steps to Lucid Dreams.

I just wanted to check in to see if you had you first lucid dream yet?

If so, I'd love to hear about it :-)

I do actually read all the replies I get to these emails and always try my best to help out. So I'm only ever an email away if you need help with your training.

**Lucid dreaming is a journey - keep exploring and keep learning!**

I'll be sending you occasional news, tips and brain hacks that I think will help you on your way. After all, I promised I would get you lucid!

Thanks

**Chris**

PS. Did lucid dreaming ever cause you to question exactly [what is reality](https://www.world-of-lucid-dreaming.com/what-is-reality.html)?

# <span id="MANYspectrums">**Do you know the MANY spectrums of lucidity?**</span>

Team,

One of the most frequent questions I get asked is simply:

"Was this a lucid dream?"

It's surprising the number of beginners that embark on their journey to lucidity without having a full understanding of what a lucid dream actually is!

**It's worth having a quick recap.**

Because the answer can help shed light for everybody - not just newbies.

So remember this:

**A lucid dream is any dream in which you are aware you are dreaming.**

That's it.

You don't have to have control, you don't have to be able to see crisp, sharp colors and you don't even have to fully remember the dream.

Of course, all these things are *possible*, but they are not *requirements* of lucidity.

**And this is where the answer starts to get a little more complex.**

Because lucidity is not a binary state!

It's not a Y/N flip switch.

Like many things in life, lucidity exists along a *spectrum*.

Actually, it exists across several spectrums!

You see, the 'lucidity' of a dream can be measured across several independent dimensions - all of which exist along their own spectrums.

For example:

- **Awareness** - from a vague inkling to deep consciousness
- **Control** - from none to advanced manipulation
- **Recall** - from blurry fragments to detailed living memory
- **Vividity** - from dull and distant to brilliant full color

So, next time you have a lucid dream (or you question whether you may have), don't talk in vague terms like "lucid" or "semi-lucid" but try to assess each aspect along a scale.

his is how academic researchers consider their dreams.

For example, the [LuCiD Scale](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23220345/) - Voss 2013.

After all, when we dive downwards into the oceans of our dreams, we are acting as researchers of our own inner world!

So pick up your archaeologist's belt, armed with your tools and scales - and go explore!

Sincerely

Chris Hammond

# <span id="toldme">I wish somebody had told me this when I first started </span>

Dreamers,

It's a beautiful sunny morning here and I wanted to send you something helpful.

Some advice that might help you gain a greater appreciation of the nature of lucid dreaming.

You see, many stumble across "lucid dreaming" online and become obsessed with it. The idea of controlling their dreams is exotic and alluring. They practice rigorously every day and invest all their energies into reading about techniques and tricks.

But they don't see results and quickly become frustrated... thinking about giving up.

Does this sound like you?

It may, because I get hundreds of emails from folks in just this situation. And my advice is always the same:

> Lucid dreaming is a **marathon**, not a **sprint**.
>
> And focus on the **journey**, not the **destination**.

Think about it. Does the marathon runner get more from the experience of running for 4 hours, or that split second he crosses the finish line?

Lucid dreaming is a long term life skill. You will never stop sleeping. There is no finish line. There is no end destination.

There will always be room to improve and there will always be room to grow.

There is no magic point at which you will suddenly become satisfied with your lucidity prowess. Accept each lucid dream as a gift and a precious grain of sand in the unending flux of energy that is our universe.

You must start your journey with this mindset. Embrace lucid dreaming as a part of your **life** for the long term and do so **patiently**.

But how do you stop yourself from burning out?

And how do you stop yourself from becoming frustrated.

You have to be grateful for and appreciate the significance of the "small wins". These are the the tiny "micro improvements" that you encounter on your journey.

It could be holding onto lucidity for just 10 seconds longer than last time. Or it could be experiencing the feeling of sleep paralysis and being able to calm the terror just a little bit more.

These are all important experiences and steps on this long journey.

For the beginners out there, remember: lucid dreaming is but an exploration of the mysterious borderland sleep states.

Do not rush into tying every fancy technique every night. Do not fret about the number of reality checks you are doing.

**Just treat every evening - as you place your head on your pillow - as a journey into the dark expansive ocean of sleep onboard the ship of your mind.**

Every spooky night time phenomenon you encounter is one small step closer and one more notch on your belt.

**Sail the ocean patiently... and it will reward you! :-)**

# <span id="HypnapompicState">🌒 The Hypnapompic State 🌘</span>

Folks,

Here's a story for ya.

I woke this morning at 4:30am.

It was black. I crawled out of bed in a half befuddled state and opened the door that leads out onto my balcony.

The night air was cool, infinitely peaceful.

Trees resting motionless and undisturbed before dawn.

\- It was eerily quiet -

The streetlights peered out at me, from across the garden - burning their image onto my vision.

As I slowly blinked, the amorphous glowing blob remained - leaving its searing mark on my internal world.

Except, it was not alone...

Even with closed eyes, I continued to see the street lamp, the trees, my balcony. The searing glow. *Everything inside, was as out.*

I blinked a few more times to see if I could observe the phenomenon again - and sure enough, shutting my eyes had no effect at all.

My garden and the blob were staring at me - eyes open *or* closed.

**This my friends is an example of a hypnopompic hallucination!**

We often talk about hypnagogia - but forget about it's twin sister hypnopompia.

While the hypnagogic state occurs *just before* we enter into sleep, the hypnopompic states occurs *just after* we awake.

They are very similar but tend to have a subtly different character.

Be aware of this.

Because when you catch yourself waking in this bizarre half-asleep state of consciousness, it's an excellent time to try for a lucid dream!

You'll know it when you see geometric patterns floating across your vision, your thoughts feel drowsy and your perception of reality is slow and dream-like.

**These are the borderland sleep states from which lucid dreams are born!**

So next time you wake extra early and all is black outside... try slumbering in bed a little longer.

Let your body drift away and focus on the back of your eyelids - you may just catch a ride to the highly bizarre and ludicrously peculiar land of hypnopompia.

(and remember, don't turn the lights on or look at your phone)

Yours

Chris Hammond
